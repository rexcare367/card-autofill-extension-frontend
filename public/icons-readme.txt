Icon Requirements for Chrome Extension
======================================

You need to add three icon files in this directory:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

You can:
- Create your own icons using design tools
- Use free icon generators online
- Download from icon libraries like Flaticon or Icons8

Make sure the icons are in PNG format and match the exact dimensions specified.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or even copy the same image three times with different sizes.

Quick way to create placeholder icons:
- Use online tools like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or use any image editor to create simple colored squares
